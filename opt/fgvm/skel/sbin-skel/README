reboot.partition
This shuts down all processes within the partition.  Currently
this just consists of lpshut and netstop.partition,  but it could have other things
added later.  (e.g. shutdown oracle)

init.partition
This is the startup program.  At least, that's the idea. Currently
it just does lpsched and /sbin/netstart.partition .  Later it
will start up other daemons.

netstart.partition
This reads /etc/partition/netconf  and creates an aliased
virtual interface (usually)

netstop.partition 
This removes the aliased interface created by netstart.partition

partitionname
Reports the contents of /etc/partitionname,  which should be the
name of this partition.
