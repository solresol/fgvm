# netconf

# This file gets sourced by /sbin/netstart.partition
# when it wants to create a unique IP address for this
# partition.
# 
# There are three variables:
#
# INTERFACE_NAME="lan1:3"    # a unique interface alias
# IP_ADDRESS="10.12.5.199"   # some unique ip address 
# NETMASK="255.255.255.0"    # the netmask associated with this
#
# there is currently no support for more than one IP address in a partition
# nor is there anything really clever with MC/ServiceGuard.
